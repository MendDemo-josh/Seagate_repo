Welcome to Seagate's openSeaChest Logs diagnostic software.

openSeaChest_Logs is a comprehensive command line tool that can be used to
extract device logs on Seagate disk drives (this includes Seagate, Maxtor,
Samsung and LaCie).  

Several binary logs are maintained on Seagate disk drives.  These logs are not
stored in the user data area. Sometimes these logs are reviewed by Seagate
engineers to help analyze event history on the device.  These binary data logs
are saved to filenames using the drive's serial number and date-time.

        Log Name:                                      Command Line Option:
        Device Statistics Log                          --deviceStatisticsLog
        Drive Self Test DST Log                        --selfTestLog
        Field Accessible Reliability Metrics Log       --farm
        Generic Standard (Host Specific) Logs          --pullLog [Log Number]
        Identify Device Data Log                       --identifyDataLog
        SATA Phy Event Counters Log                    --SATAPhyCntLog
        SCSI Informational Exceptions Log              --infoExceptionsLog

Seagate does not support unsolicited log retrieval review requests.

Important note: Many tests in this tool directly reference storage device data
sectors, also known as Logical Block Addresses (LBA). Test arguments may
require a starting LBA or an LBA range.  The predefined variable 'maxLBA'
refers to the last sector on the drive.  Many older SATA and SAS storage
controllers (also known as Host Bus Adapters [HBA]) have a maximum addressable
limit of 4294967295 [FFFFh] LBAs hard wired into their design.  This equates to
2.1TB using 512 byte sectors.  This also means accessing an LBA beyond the
2.1TB limitation either will result in an error or simply the last readable LBA
(usually LBA 4294967295 [FFFFh]) depending on the actual hardware.  This
limitation can have important consequences.  For example, if you intended to
erase a 4TB drive, then only the first 2TB will actually get erased (or maybe
even twice!) and the last 2TB will remain untouched.  You should carefully
evaluate your system hardware to understand if your storage controllers provide
support for greater than 2.1TB.

Note: One gigabyte, or GB, equals one billion bytes when referring to hard
drive capacity. This software may use information provided by the operating
system to display capacity and volume size. The Windows file system uses a
binary calculation for gibibyte or GiB (2^30) which causes the abbreviated size
to appear smaller. The total number of bytes on a disk drive divided by the
decimal calculation for gigabyte or GB (10^9) shows the expected abbreviated
size. See this FAQ for more information

NOTE: openSeaChest_Logs may not be fully functional on non-Seagate
drives.
