Welcome to Seagate's openSeaChest PassthroughTest diagnostic software.

openSeaChest_PassThroughTest is a comprehensive command line tool that can be
used to identify and analyze the unique quirks which may be present in a
USB-to-SATA or USB-to-NVMe bridge adapter.  The findings from this tool are
studied to help optimize openSeaChest libraries to send the best and safest
device interface commands, which are passed through to the storage device.

NOTE: openSeaChest_PassThroughTest may not be fully functional on non-Seagate
drives.

If this is your drive, you should always keep a current backup of your
important data.

Note: One gigabyte, or GB, equals one billion bytes when referring to hard
drive capacity. This software may use information provided by the operating
system to display capacity and volume size. The Windows file system uses a
binary calculation for gibibyte or GiB (2^30) which causes the abbreviated size
to appear smaller. The total number of bytes on a disk drive divided by the
decimal calculation for gigabyte or GB (10^9) shows the expected abbreviated
size. See this FAQ for more information
