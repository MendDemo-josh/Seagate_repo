Welcome to Seagate's openSeaChest_Firmware diagnostic software.

openSeaChest_Firmware is a comprehensive command line tool that can be used to
update firmware, also known as microcode, on Seagate disk drives (this includes
Seagate, Maxtor, Samsung and LaCie).

Seagate products are run by firmware.  Having the latest firmware can improve
performance and or reliability of your product.  Seagate recommends applying
new firmware to enhance the performance and or reliability of your drive.  Like
any software, firmware is improved over time and problems are also fixed.Ã‚Â 
Every drive family has a couple of firmware releases during the life of the
product.Ã‚Â  Please check in regularly to determine if new firmware is available
for your drive.

openSeaChest_Firmware allows for both single drive and sequential batch mode
firmware download.

NOTE: Windows severely restricts downloading firmware to SATA drives.  Please
see the section below "Windows Restrictions Over SATA Firmware Downloads".
openSeaChest_Firmware may not be fully functional on non-Seagate drives.

If this is your drive, you should always keep a current backup of your
important data.

Be very careful using openSeaChest_Firmware. Power failure during a firmware
download will cause data loss. Never apply firmware to a drive unless you are
certain that the firmware data file is specifically prepared for your drive.
Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.
