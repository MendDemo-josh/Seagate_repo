Windows Restrictions Over SATA Firmware Downloads
-------------------------------------------------
You should not attempt downloading firmware to a SATA disk drive in the Windows
operating system unless the drive supports the 'deferred' mode.  You define the
mode with the SeaChest command line option '--downloadMode deferred'.  If
the drive does not support deferred mode then the command will be aborted.
Windows may not be so restrictive on secondary, non-boot SATA drives or SATA
drives attached to host bus adapters (HBAs, controllers, USB, etc).

If you force a primary SATA boot drive to download firmware in Windows using a
different --downloadMode setting, then the result will likely be a BSOD (blue
screen of death) system crash.  This is because the legacy SATA firmware
download modes require the drive to spin down and then back up and the
momentary disappearance of the drive causes the operating system to crash.
Windows is actually protecting the system when it thinks the drive has stopped
responding (see wikis about Ring 0 Protection).

The 'deferred' mode does not spin down the drive.  Instead, the drive waits for
a future reboot of the system and self-activates the firmware at that time.
Other operating systems may utilize the SeaChest --activateFW command to
trigger the switch to the new firmware version.
