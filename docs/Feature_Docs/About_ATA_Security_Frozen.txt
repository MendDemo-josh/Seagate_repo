When drives are reported Security "Frozen" by SeaChest
------------------------------------------------------
Note:  Your system or the SeaChest software may report that a SATA password
cannot be changed because it is "frozen". Many systems BIOS will automatically
set the ATA SECURITY FREEZE LOCK command on all SATA drives at start up. The
SECURITY FREEZE LOCK command prevents changes to all Security states until a
following power-on reset or hardware reset. The purpose of the SECURITY FREEZE
LOCK command is to prevent password setting attacks on the security system.

The SeaChest --deviceInfo command will display something similar to this: "ATA
Security Information: Supported, Frozen". To disable Freeze Lock, first check
your BIOS SATA disk options to control the setting at start up. Otherwise, you
might pause the boot up shortly after powering on the system and then
temporarily remove the power to the security frozen drive (let it completely
spin down). When the power is back on the drive it will start without being
frozen.

Windows systems may also decide not to recognize the drive if it is ATA
Security Locked and it will not be listed by the SeaChest --scan command.  If
the drive remains undetected in Windows, your alternative is to make a bootable
USB flash drive and run SeaChest_Erase from the Linux operating system.
