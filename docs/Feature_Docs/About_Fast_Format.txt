About FastFormat
================
A FastFormat (quickly changing the logical sector size) may take a few minutes
for the process to complete. The disk activity LED may show activity during the
conversion.  The larger the drive, the longer it takes.

NOTE: Operating systems do a device discovery during start up and set various
parameters, like total sectors and sector size, into the storage device
descriptions. The logical sector size times the number or logical sectors
defines the drive capacity.  You should expect to see OS I/O errors if you
change the logical sector size on a drive and then perform read or write
operations before the OS has updated its storage device descriptions.  Some
operating systems will throw an error after accessing a drive that has just run
a FastFormat but during its error recovery routines it may re-discover the
device parameters and update the system logs.  A system restart, however, is
the most reliable way to refresh the storage device descriptions.
