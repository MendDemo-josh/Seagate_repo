Utility Arguments
.br
=================
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-scan\fR
.IP
Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical
/dev/sg? assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware
numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately
after booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.
.HP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-device\fR deviceHandle
.IP
Use this option with most commands to specify the device
handle on which to perform an operation. Example: /dev/sg?
.HP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-deviceInfo\fR
.IP
Show information and features for the storage device
.HP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-scanFlags\fR [option list]
.IP
Use this option to control the output from scan with the
options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
.IP
ata \- show only ATA (SATA) devices
.br
usb \- show only USB devices
.br
scsi \- show only SCSI (SAS) devices
.br
interfaceATA \- show devices on an ATA interface
.br
interfaceUSB \- show devices on a USB interface
.br
interfaceSCSI \- show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
.br
sd \- show sd device handles
.br
sgtosd \- show the sd and sg device handle mapping
.HP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-Scan\fR
.IP
This option is the same as \fB\-\-scan\fR or \fB\-s\fR,
however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick up
other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low
power states and may cause the OS to re\-enumerate them.
Use this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in
a normal scan.
.br
NOTE: A low\-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces or
all OSs. The low\-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional
devices in the system when the device is unable to come to a ready state.
.HP
\fB\-\-SATInfo\fR
.IP
Displays SATA device information on any interface
using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported data
(translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log
reported data.
.HP
\fB\-\-testUnitReady\fR
.IP
Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the
status. If the drive is not ready, the sense key, asc,
ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable
translation from the SPC spec will be displayed if one
is available.
.HP
\fB\-\-active\fR
.IP
This command will transition a drive to the active power state.
This uses a ATA read\-verify command to a random LBA, or a SCSI
start\-stop unit command.
.HP
\fB\-\-changePower\fR
.IP
Use this option to enable or disable certain \fB\-\-powerMode\fR and
their timers. You can also use this option to restore default
values to the drive.
.HP
\fB\-\-checkPowerMode\fR
.IP
Get the current power mode of a drive.
On SCSI devices, this will only work if the drive has
transitioned from active state to another state.
.HP
\fB\-\-defaultMode\fR
.IP
Use this option with the change power mode option restore the
default settings for a specific power mode.
.HP
\fB\-\-disableMode\fR
.IP
Use this option with the change power mode option to disable
a specific power mode.
.HP
\fB\-\-EPCfeature\fR [enable | disable]
.IP
Enables or disables Extended Power Conditions (EPC) support for
devices. To disable EPC use \fB\-\-EPCfeature\fR disable. Note that the
EPC Feature Set is not supported on all devices.
Use \fB\-\-deviceInfo\fR option to see if EPC is supported.
.HP
\fB\-\-enableMode\fR
.IP
Use this option with the change power mode option to enable
a specific power mode.
.HP
\fB\-\-idle\fR
.IP
This command will transition a drive to the idle power state.
This command may flush the cache before the transition to this state.
This command is for non\-EPC enabled drives. If the drive has the EPC
feature enabled, it is recommended that the \fB\-\-transitionPower\fR option
be used instead. This option is compatible with EPC enabled drives as well,
but offers less control over the transition.
If the operating system selects this drive, it will transition it back to
an active state.
.HP
\fB\-\-idleUnload\fR
.IP
This command will transition a drive to the idle, heads unloaded, power state.
This command may flush the cache before the transition to this state.
This command is for non\-EPC enabled drives. If the drive has the EPC
feature enabled, it is recommended that the \fB\-\-transitionPower\fR option
be used instead. This option is compatible with EPC enabled drives as well,
but offers less control over the transition.
If the operating system selects this drive, it will transition it back to
an active state.
.HP
\fB\-\-powerMode\fR [powermode]
.IP
Use this option to specify a power mode. This should be used
with the \fB\-\-transitionPower\fR or \fB\-\-changePower\fR options.
.IP
Valid power modes (SAS and SATA):
.br
idle_a
.br
idle_b
.br
idle_c
.br
standby_y (SAS only)
.br
standby_z
.br
active (SAS only)
.br
all (enable or disable only)
.IP
Valid power modes (NVMe): 0 \- 30
.HP
\fB\-\-showEPCSettings\fR
.IP
Use this option to show the current EPC settings on the screen.
Only drives supporting the EPC feature will show this data and
only supported power conditions will be shown.
.HP
\fB\-\-sleep\fR
.IP
This command will transition a drive to the sleep power state.
A reset must be sent to wake a drive from sleep state.
The OS may not be able to wake a drive from this state once it has
been entered. Use this option with caution!
.HP
\fB\-\-spinDown\fR
.IP
Removes power to the disk drive motor with the Standby Immediate
command. Use this before moving a hard disk drive. The drive
will spin back up if the operating system selects the drive.
This means that an active drive will not stay spun down.
.HP
\fB\-\-standby\fR
.IP
This command will transition a drive to the standby power state.
This command will flush the cache before the transition to this state.
This command is for non\-EPC enabled drives. If the drive has the EPC
feature enabled, it is recommended that the \fB\-\-transitionPower\fR option
be used instead. This option is compatible with EPC enabled drives as well,
but offers less control over the transition.
On an HDD, this will cause the spindle motor to stop.
If the operating system selects this drive, it will transition it back to
an active state.
.HP
\fB\-\-modeTimer\fR [timer value in milliseconds]
.IP
Use this option to specify a timer value to use with the
\fB\-\-changePower\fR mode option.
.HP
\fB\-\-transitionPower\fR
.IP
Use this option to transition the drive to a specific
power state
.PP
