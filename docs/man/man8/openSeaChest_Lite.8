Utility Arguments
.br
=================
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-scan\fR
.IP
Scan the system and list all storage devices with Physical
Device assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware numbers.
If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately after
booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.
.HP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-device\fR <deviceHandle>
.IP
Use this option with all commands, except \fB\-\-scan\fR, to specify
the device handle (target drive) on which to
perform an operation.
.IP
Example: \fB\-d\fR /dev/sg? (case sensitive)
.HP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-deviceInfo\fR
.IP
Show information and features for the storage device. USB
devices will show the product name, serial and firmware numbers
as communicated by the USB\-SATA bridge.  Add \fB\-\-usbChildInfo\fR
to display details about the drive within the USB enclosure.
.HP
\fB\-\-downloadFW\fR firmware_filename
.IP
Download firmware to a Seagate storage product. Use only
Seagate authorized firmware data files which are designated for
the specific model drive. Improper use of this option may harm
a device and or its data. You may specify the path if the
firmware data file is in a different location. This option will
use segmented download by default.
.HP
\fB\-\-showSupportedSectorSizes\fR
.IP
This option will show the supported sector sizes of a device if
it reports them. These can be used to change the sector size or
used with a format unit operation. On SAS, this is the
supported block lengths and protection types VPD page. (SBC4
and later) On SATA, this is the sector configuration log. (ACS4
and later) If the device does not report supported sector
sizes, please consult your product manual.
.HP
\fB\-\-shortDST\fR
.IP
Execute a short diagnostic drive self test. This test can take
up to 2 minutes to complete. Use with the \fB\-\-poll\fR argument to
let SeaChest check for progress and print it to the screen
until complete.  If the \fB\-\-poll\fR argument is not used then the
test begins and immediately returns to the command prompt.  Use
the \fB\-\-progress\fR DST command to check on the completion
percentage (%) and test result. The poll argument does not
return to the command prompt and prints ongoing completion
percentages (%) until the final test result.
.IP
Note: Use \fB\-\-progress\fR DST to see details about the last DST
run on the drive.
.HP
\fB\-\-poll\fR
.IP
Use this option to cause another operation to poll for progress
until it has completed.  This argument does not return to the
command prompt and prints ongoing completion percentages (%)
and the final test result.Used with \fB\-\-shortDST\fR.
.HP
\fB\-\-progress\fR [dst]
.IP
Get the progress for a test that was started quietly (default).
The progress counts up from 0% to 100%.

Utility Options
.br
===============
.HP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.IP
Show utility options and example usage (this output you see now)
.HP
\fB\-\-license\fR
.IP
Display the Seagate End User License Agreement (EULA).
.HP
\fB\-\-modelMatch\fR [model Number]
.IP
Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
model number. This option will provide a closest match although
an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001.
The option \fB\-\-childModelMatch\fR may be used to match drives in USB
enclosures.
.HP
\fB\-\-onlySeagate\fR
.IP
Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options
provided
.HP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
.IP
Show openSeaChest_Lite version and copyright information & exit

Data Destructive Commands (Seagate only)
.br
========================================
.br
Data destructive commands will require additional command line arguments as
confirmation of your understanding that data will be lost on the drive.
Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.
.TP
\fB\-\-setSectorSize\fR [new sector size]
.IP
This option is only available for drives that support sector
size changes. On SATA Drives, the Set Sector Configuration
command must be supported. On SAS Drives, Fast Format must be
supported. Please consult your product manual to verify support.
.IP
This option can be used to quickly change the logical
sector size between 5xx emulation and 4xxx native logical block
sizes, usually 512 and 4096. Resulting LBA (sector) count is
either \fI\,/8\/\fP or *8 the current Read Capacity or Identify,
depending on the direction of the conversion.  The conversion
between logical sector sizes can take a few minutes.  Do not
interrupt this operation.
.HP
\fB\-\-confirm\fR I\-understand\-this\-command\-will\-erase\-all\-data\-on\-the\-drive
.IP
This option should be used only with Data Destructive Commands
