after booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.
.HP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-Scan\fR
.IP
This option is the same as \fB\-\-scan\fR or \fB\-s\fR,
however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick up
other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low
power states and may cause the OS to re\-enumerate them.
Use this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in
a normal scan.
NOTE: A low\-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces or
all OSs. The low\-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional
devices in the system when the device is unable to come to a ready state.
.HP
\fB\-\-SATInfo\fR
.IP
Displays SATA device information on any interface
using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported data
(translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log
reported data.
.HP
\fB\-\-testUnitReady\fR
.IP
Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the
status. If the drive is not ready, the sense key, asc,
ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable
translation from the SPC spec will be displayed if one
is available.
.HP
\fB\-\-fastDiscovery\fR
.TP

to issue a fast scan on the specified drive.
.HP
\fB\-\-phySpeed\fR [0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5]

3 \- allow negotiation up to 6.0Gb/s
4 \- allow negotiation up to 12.0Gb/s (SAS Only)
5 \- allow negotiation up to 22.5Gb/s (SAS Only)
.IP
NOTE: SATA phy speed changes are only available on Seagate drives.
.TP
WARNING: Check the minimum phy speed supported by your adapter before

.IP
Use this option to enable or disable write cache
support on a drive. Use the "info" argument to get
the current status of the write cache feature.
.TP
WARNING: Changing Write Cache may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
with multiple logical units or namespaces.
.IP
SATA Only:
========
\fB\-\-freeFall\fR [info | enable | disable | sensitivity value]        (SATA only)
.IP
Use this option to configure the Free Fall control feature
found on some SATA drives. This feature allows the drive to
take action if it detects it is in free fall to protect the data
from harm due to a drop.
.TP
info \- use this to see the current sensitivity value
enable \- this option will set the sensitivity to the vendor's
.TP
recommended value.
disable \- this will disable the free fall control feature.

.TP
how sensitive the detection is. A value of zero
will set the vendor's recommended value.
.TP
\fB\-\-lowCurrentSpinup\fR [ low | ultra | disable ]
(SATA Only) (Seagate Only)
.IP
Use this option to set the state of the low current spinup
feature on Seagate SATA drives.
When this setting is enabled for low or ultra low mode,
the drive will take longer to spinup and become ready.
Note: This feature is not available on every drive.
Note: Some products will support low, but not the ultra
.IP
low current spinup mode.
.TP
\fB\-\-puisFeature\fR [ enable | disable ]
(SATA Only)
.IP
Use this option to enable or disable the power up in standby

Note: If this is configured on the drive with a jumper, this
.IP
command will fail.
.IP
Note2: Not all products support this feature.
.HP
\fB\-\-sscFeature\fR [info | default | enable | disable] (SATA Only) (Seagate Only)
.IP
Use this option to change or view the SSC (Spread Spectrum
Clocking) mode on a Seagate SATA drive. Only change this
setting if you are experiencing compatibility problems with
the drive in a system.
info \- show current SSC state
default \- set to drive default mode
enable \- enable SSC
disable \- disable SSC
.HP
\fB\-\-sctReadTimer\fR [info | value] (SATA Only)
.IP
Use this option to set the read command timer value for
synchronous commands and NCQ commands with in\-order data
delivery enabled. Note: this timer starts at the time that
the drive processes the command, not the time it is received.
This timer value is volatile and is cleared at each power cycle.
Use the "info" argument to get the current status
of the read timer. A value of 0 means that all possible
error recovery will be performed before returning status.
Other values should include a unit to know the time to use.
If no unit is provided, it is assumed to be the value * 100 ms
Ex1: \fB\-\-sctReadTimer\fR 15s for a 15 second timer.
Ex2: \fB\-\-sctReadTimer\fR 15000ms for a 15 second timer expressed in milliseconds
Ex2: \fB\-\-sctReadTimer\fR 150 for a 15 second timer with no units specified
The maximum time that can be specified is 1 hour, 49 minutes, 13 seconds
Note: On some SAT HBAs/bridges, status will not be able to be
determined due to HBA/bridge limitations.
.HP
\fB\-\-sctWriteCache\fR [info | enable | disable | default] (SATA Only)
.IP
Use this option to enable or disable write cache
support on a drive using SMART command transport.
When using this option, the setting is non\-volatile.
Use this with the \fB\-\-volatile\fR flag to make the
setting volatile.
When using this option, the \fB\-\-writeCache\fR option
will always return success, but no write cache changes
will occur. This follows ATA spec.
Using the "default" argument returns the drive to
default settings and allowing the \fB\-\-writeCache\fR
option to work again.
Use the "info" argument to get the current status
of the write cache feature. Note: On some SAT
HBAs/bridges, status will not be able to be
determined due to HBA/bridge limitations.
.HP
\fB\-\-sctWriteCacheReordering\fR [info | enable | disable | default] (SATA Only)
.IP
Use this option to enable or disable write cache reordering
support on a drive using SMART command transport.
Write cache reordering allows the drive to reorder moving data
out of cache to media for better performance on synchronous
commands. Asynchronous commands are only affected when in\-order
data delivery is enabled.
When using this option, the setting is non\-volatile.
Use this with the \fB\-\-volatile\fR flag to make the
setting volatile.
Use the "info" argument to get the current status
of the write cache reordering feature. Note: On some SAT
HBAs/bridges, status will not be able to be
determined due to HBA/bridge limitations.
.HP
\fB\-\-sctWriteTimer\fR [info | value] (SATA Only)
.IP
Use this option to set the write command timer value for
synchronous commands and NCQ commands with in\-order data
delivery enabled. Note: this timer starts at the time that
the drive processes the command, not the time it is received.
This timer value is volatile and is cleared at each power cycle.
Use the "info" argument to get the current status
of the write timer. A value of 0 means that all possible
error recovery will be performed before returning status.
Other values should include a unit to know the time to use.
If no unit is provided, it is assumed to be the value * 100 ms
Ex1: \fB\-\-sctWriteTimer\fR 15s for a 15 second timer.
Ex2: \fB\-\-sctWriteTimer\fR 15000ms for a 15 second timer expressed in milliseconds
Ex2: \fB\-\-sctWriteTimer\fR 150 for a 15 second timer with no units specified
The maximum time that can be specified is 1 hour, 49 minutes, 13 seconds
Note: On some SAT HBAs/bridges, status will not be able to be
determined due to HBA/bridge limitations.

\fB\-\-sasPhy\fR [phy number] (SAS Only)
.IP
Use this option to specify a specific phy to use
with another option that uses a phy identifier value.
Some tool options will assume all SAS Phys when this
option is not present. Others will produce an error when
a specific phy is needed for an operation.
Use the \fB\-i\fR option to learn more about the supported phys.
.TP
\fB\-\-scsiLPReset\fR [cumulative | threshold | defCumulative | defThreshold | all]
(SAS only)
.IP
Use this option to reset all SCSI Log Pages.
If the device is compliant with SPC4 or later, the
